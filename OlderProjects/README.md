# Brody_Personal_Projects_and_Files
This is just a repository of assorted files, projects, and things I have made over time. Feel free to reference the code.

None of these files were designed for multi-person use. 
Every file here (are ones that don't have confidential info in them) was for personal use for pulling or manipulating data.

As such the commenting and organization is not particularly pretty.
